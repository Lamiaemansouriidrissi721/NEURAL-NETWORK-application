House Price Prediction Using ANN 🏡📈

This project implements an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in Python to predict house prices based on various features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, living area size, location, and more. The goal is to build a model that accurately estimates house prices using real-world data.
Purpose

    Build an end-to-end machine learning pipeline using Keras, NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn.
    Develop a regression model using a deep neural network to predict continuous values (house prices).
    Gain hands-on experience with neural networks, data preprocessing, and model evaluation.

Dataset

The dataset used contains detailed information on houses, including:

    Features: Number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, year built, renovated status, etc.
    Target: House price.
